Within the Static folder, there are three folders "css," "html," and "js." Together the files within these folders helped me understand how to create a simple input website that stores the input from the client to the creator. The input shows up in the terminal once the user submits. 

Noteworthy files, "hello.html," "submit2.html," and "submit3.html" change these within "inputValidation.js" to create differnt web designs and input types.

To run: node inputValidation.js in terminal, within a new browser type "localhost:3000"
